- `MCMC_analysis.ipynb`: outputing the results from various MCMC runs. Corner plots and trace plots. 
- `Universe_Machine.ipynb`: compare our results to UM catalogs (check DS, SMF, SHMR, taking orphans into account).
- `plot_sigma_and_make_catalogs.ipynb`: making mock catalogs from best fit model parameters. Plotting scatter figures for comparison with galaxies without DM, using results from Asher Wasserman's DDD model.
