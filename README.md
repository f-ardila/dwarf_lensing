# Measuring weak lensing in dwarf galaxies
Project goal: Use MCMC to determine best fit parameters for Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation (SHMR) model using variable scatter using weak lensing and stellar mass function (SMF).

## Directories
- `MCMC`: most of the work is done here. This is where MCMCs were run to fit model parameters to data.
- `notebooks`: notebooks for initial tests
- `mock_dwarfs`: catalogs of mock dwarf galaxies built by sampling existing COSMOS dwarfs to match distribution.
- `useful_halotools_scripts`: python scripts for adding local particle and halo catalogs to halotools cache.
- `Data`: too large for GitHub. data in lux: `/data/groups/leauthaud/fardila/dwarf_lensing`
