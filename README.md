# Improved SHMR for dwarf galaxies using weak lensing
**_Project goal_**: Determine best fit parameters for empirical Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation (SHMR) model for dwarf galaxies in Bolshoi-Planck simulation, using MCMC techniques to fit to observed weak lensing and stellar mass function (SMF) data of dwarf galaxies from the COSMOS field catalog ([Laigle et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJS..224...24L/abstract)).

## Directories
- `MCMC`: most of the work is done here. This is where MCMCs were run to fit model parameters to data.
- `notebooks`: notebooks for initial tests in MCMC development.
- `useful_halotools_scripts`: python scripts for adding local particle and halo catalogs to halotools cache.
- `Data`: too large for GitHub. data in lux: `/data/groups/leauthaud/fardila/dwarf_lensing`
