# Notebooks
- `bplanck_dwarfs_matched_distribution.ipynb` : we use the subsamples of bplanck galaxies with mass distributions matched to COSMOS to measure lensing.
- `dwarf_lensing.ipynb` : first step in the project and provides a general overview of the data, the goal, and the methods.
- `halotools_vs_chris.ipynb` : comparing the use of halotools vs. Chris Bradshaw's code for creating a stellar mass sample using SHMR parameters. Chris' code is faster because it's more specialized.
- `histogram_with_Asher_ddd.ipynb` : results from Asher's run of his Dark matter Deficient Doppelgangers (DDDs). Uses file `ddd.hdf5`
- `variable_scatter_demo.ipynb` : demo from Andrew Hearin showing how to use halotools to build SHMR mdoel with variable scatter
